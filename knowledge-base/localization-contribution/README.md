**Global Open-Source Enthusiasts and Community Organizations:**

Dear all, greetings! The deepin operating system, originating from China, aims to serve users worldwide. We sincerely hope more users can personally experience this Linux distribution from China. To this end, we continuously strive to improve localization to ensure that deepin delivers the best experience to users across the globe.

In the brand-new deepin 25 version, we have comprehensively optimized and innovated the system. New features span multiple modules, including the installer, taskbar, control center, file manager, notifications, and window compositor. However, recognizing the diversity of global users, we understand that the system still has room for improvement in supporting localized languages for international users. As an open-source community, we are dedicated to enhancing global language translations, but our current team's resources may limit the pace of progress.

Therefore, we sincerely invite all open-source enthusiasts to join our translation team!

- If you find errors or imprecisions in the current translations, we welcome your feedback and assistance in correcting them to further improve translation quality.
- If you are willing to contribute to translating languages not yet supported by deepin, we warmly welcome your participation to accelerate the improvement of deepin's global language support system.

Every contribution you make is a solid step in helping deepin reach the world and serve users globally. Let us work together to build a stronger deepin community and allow more users to experience the unique charm of the deepin operating system!

Finally, we once again sincerely invite open-source enthusiasts and community organizations worldwide to join us in localizing and translating the deepin operating system!
